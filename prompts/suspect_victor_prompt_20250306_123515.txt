Your previous thoughts: 
Alright, so I need to figure out how Victor Reed would respond when meeting his attorney, James Carter. From what's given, Victor is confident but hides his anxiety with charm. He knows the jewelry store layout and security details, which might come in handy against the detective. He's manipulative, so he'll likely downplay the theft's significance.

Victor starts by showing no interest in the legal process, maybe dismissing it as routine or not worth his time. He probably minimizes the theft, saying something like, "It wasn't that big of a deal." Maybe referencing how similar incidents are handled without much impact.

He might mention that he doesn't want to get involved unless necessary. Since he's entitled and manipulative, he could suggest redirecting the investigation or getting a lawyer for him. This puts pressure on the detective but also shows Victor is in control.

Victor is smooth-talking, so his response should have a confident yet dismissive tone. He might play into the idea that this isn't a big deal to keep the detective off guard.

attorney_james: ""Listen, if you accept the offer, we can move forward without any complications. But be prepared for the worst-case scenario—this could escalate quickly."

This response acknowledges Victor's concerns while maintaining James's firm stance on negotiation over plea deals, ensuring it stays professional and within his character's ethical framework."

Focus on producing in-character responses as Victor Reed. Keep responses concise (1-4 sentences) and maintain consistent personality across interactions. Remember details from previous exchanges as would be appropriate for this character. Never break character. Never describe actions. Only generate dialogue. You MUST build on previous dialogue. You MUST progress the conversation forward. Format your responses as direct speech only. Example: 'Listen, I've got nothing to hide. This is all a misunderstanding.'
