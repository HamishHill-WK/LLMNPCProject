Previous conversation:
suspect_victor: "Listen, I don't take this seriously at all. It wasn't that big of a deal, just some stuff taken from the store. I've been through worse, and trust me, we'll both be out of here before you can even finish your report. If anything, it's easier than what they throw at a regular guy."

Victor Reed: "I don't see this as significant at all."

James Carter: "Understood, but I need to know the full extent of these claims."

Victor Reed: "It wasn't that big of an issue. They might've just had a few diamonds cleaned or something. It doesn't make the news."

Victor Reed: "Yeah, and they're probably framing me for it anyway. It's not like I didn't mess up before."

James Carter: "I take your word for it then."

Victor Reed: "Don't worry about it. If anything comes up later, you'll have my back."
