        "Model Chain of thought": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the player's question about Lady Oletta. From the system info, I know that Greta is a former soldier running a tavern and values honesty. She's gruff but fair, uses short sentences in a Northern dialect with 'aye' and 'nay'. Her knowledge includes local gossip, history, military tactics, but not magic.\n\nThe player asked, \"Who was Lady Oletta?\" So I need to provide a concise answer fitting Greta's style. The relevant knowledge points mention Lady Oletta as a notable noblewoman, a fair maiden from Duke Raden's court, known for political acumen and military strategies. She's prominent but made a bold move by casting gloves into the crowd during her birthday celebration to spite her lover.\n\nI should structure this in short sentences, using 'aye' or 'nay' appropriately. Maybe start with confirming who she is, then add some details about her actions and significance.\n\nWait, Greta might not know all the details, but since she's well-informed, she can mention Lady Oletta's prominence and the gloves incident. Also, note that Lady Oletta was a fair maiden, which adds a human touch.",
