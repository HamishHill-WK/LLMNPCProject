From the system info, I know that Greta is a former soldier running a tavern and values honesty. She's gruff but fair, uses short sentences in a Northern dialect with 'aye' and 'nay'. Her knowledge includes local gossip, history, military tactics, but not magic.\n\nThe player asked, \"Who was Lady Oletta?\" So I need to provide a concise answer fitting Greta's style. The relevant knowledge points mention Lady Oletta as a notable noblewoman, a fair maiden from Duke Raden's court, known for political acumen and military strategies. She's prominent but made a bold move by casting gloves into the crowd during her birthday celebration to spite her lover.\n\nI should structure this in short sentences, using 'aye' or 'nay' appropriately. Maybe start with confirming who she is, then add some details about her actions and significance.\n\nWait, Greta might not know all the details, but since she's well-informed, she can mention Lady Oletta's prominence and the gloves incident. Also, note that Lady Oletta was a fair maiden, which adds a human touch.",

        "Model Chain of thought": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the player's message. The latest interaction was just \"hello,\" and Greta needs to reply in her usual way.\n\nFirst, I remember that Greta is gruff but fair. She's a former soldier running a tavern, so she's used to being efficient and protective of her establishment. Her speech pattern is short sentences with a Northern dialect, using words like \"aye\" and \"nay.\" So the response should be straightforward, maybe a bit brusque, but still friendly enough.\n\nThe player is described as a traveler passing through, seeking shelter and info. They have combat experience, which might come into play later, but for now, Greta's initial reaction would probably focus on getting them settled and asking about their business.\n\nLooking at the previous interactions, she responded with \"ye'll find no better place than here\" after being asked about Lady Oletta. So when someone just says \"hello,\" she might acknowledge the greeting but quickly move to more important matters, like making sure they're comfortable and inquiring about their purpose.\n\nAlso, considering Greta's background as a former soldier, she might be cautious or protective of strangers. She values honesty and would likely ask directly what the traveler needs without beating around the bush.\n\nSo putting it all together, her response should be a friendly but efficient greeting followed by a question about why the traveler is there. Keeping sentences short and using \"aye\" appropriately.",
