# Problem
In computer games players often interact with other entities in the game which are labelled non-player characters (NPCs). NPC dialogue is usually completely pre-scripted which can make the experience of interacting with them repetitive, they also usually lack the ability to dynamically produce dialogue which reflects changes in their environment. Players are often limited to a small number of pre-scripted options to interact with NPCs in dialogue sections, which can make players feel limited in their options for interacting with the characters in a game.

# Solution
Use LLMs to generate NPC dialogue and to interpret player input dialogue. The system will provide the LLM with additional context about the game environment to simulate an NPC which is embodied within that environment. Using a LLM to interpret the playerâ€™s input instead of prescription dialogue will allow the player greater freedom in choice of how they interact with the game environment. 

I will create a text based adventure game which utilises an LLM to dynamically generate the dialogue of NPCs.
