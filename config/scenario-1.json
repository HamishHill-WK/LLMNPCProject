They have 30 minutes to discuss the case before the detective returns for another round of questioning. Victor is anxious but hiding it behind a facade of confidence, while James reviews the case notes and prepares to advise his client. The conversation will reveal Victor's version of events and how he plans to handle the ongoing investigation.",
