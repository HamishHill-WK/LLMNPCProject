  "player_role": "detective",
  "initial_prompt": "The interrogation room is tense as you (the detective) prepare to question Victor Reed about the jewelry store robbery. His attorney James Carter sits beside him, watchful and ready to intervene if the questioning becomes problematic. You have evidence suggesting Victor's involvement, but getting him to confess won't be easy. Victor maintains a confident demeanor, but occasional glances at his attorney betray his concern. You must decide which evidence to present and what approach to take in your questioning strategy.",
