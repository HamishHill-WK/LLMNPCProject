  "npcs": ["suspect_lisa", "attorney_james"],
  "player_role": "detective",
  "initial_prompt": "Lisa Morales sits nervously across the table, fidgeting with a tissue as you (the detective) prepare to question her about the jewelry store robbery. Her attorney James Carter sits beside her, providing a calming presence while remaining vigilant about her legal rights. Lisa's eyes are red from crying, and she periodically checks the time - likely thinking about her son. You have evidence connecting her to the crime, but her demeanor suggests she might be more willing to talk than her co-suspect. You must decide how to approach the interrogation to determine her role in the robbery.",
