  "initial_prompt": "The evidence is clear that both Victor Reed and Lisa Morales were involved in the jewelry store robbery, but determining who was the mastermind and who was the accomplice remains uncertain. As the detective, you have 48 hours to secure a confession from one or both suspects before charges must be filed. The stolen jewelry was found in a car registered to Lisa but frequently used by Victor. Security footage shows two figures at the scene, but faces aren't clearly visible. Your interrogation tactics and evidence presentation will influence whether either suspect confesses and implicates the other.",
