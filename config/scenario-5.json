  "initial_prompt": "Victor Reed sits alone in the interrogation room, checking his watch impatiently. His attorney James Carter is running late due to unexpected traffic. You have approximately 10 minutes to question Victor before legal representation arrives - a valuable window of opportunity where he might be more vulnerable to questioning. Victor appears confident but there's a hint of nervousness in his demeanor now that he's without his attorney. You must decide how to use this limited time: build rapport, apply pressure, or extract key information before the attorney arrives to manage the conversation.",
